The honest reason that we used my flash drive instead of my partner's
is because my partner accidentally left his flash drive at home. 
However, we realize that his flash drive probably would've contained
the more efficient code, because in my code, there were cases where
my code could've been written a lot better. For instance, originally
I had an if else-if statement that checked to make sure that only
the indexes of found names' data would be calculated, when it was a lot 
better to use a boolean variable to check to see if the name was found. 
Another thing that we revised in my code was when we type in the names
of the input and output files. We revised it so that the entered input 
would be used to open the files.
